# Programming and Scripting Project
by: Daniel Finnerty

## Introduction

This project is for demonstrating the ability to analyse the Fisher Iris data set using Python through both recently learned knowledge and research. In addition to the Python program (analysis.py), the Jupyter notebook outlines reasoning for certain coding, discussions of outputs, and references for any external material used.

## Tasks
Week 1. Create Jupyter notebook
        Research and review the Fisher Iris data set.
        Provide overview and findings.

Week 2. Download data set to repository
        Create Python file
        Write coding to log summary to text file

Week 3. Create code for histogram generation
        Capture outputs and record analysis of findings

Week 4. Draft code for scatter plot creation
        Review results and provide comments

Week 5. Review full program, outputs and findings
        Investigate if any further analysis is required
        Creaate associated code.

Week 6. Final run through and adjustments as required
