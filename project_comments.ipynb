    "To create histograms for each of the 4 variables, rather than repeating the code each time and only adjusting for the different variables, a function was created to simplify the code.  \n",
    "Initially the function was written in it simplest form to create a histogram of one variable by specifying the variable for 'x'. Given there are 3 differnt species, seaborn was used to allow for modification of the plot.  \n",

    "```\n",
    "This set the number of bins, or columns, which are plotted. this requires adjustment to get a correct figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the code functioning, it was then expanded to factor in the 4 different variables. This was achieved by specifying 'x' as 'variable' and creating a list of the variables, titled 'variables'. In addition to this, adding 'for variable in variables:' to the function, means that the function runs for each item listed in 'variables'"
